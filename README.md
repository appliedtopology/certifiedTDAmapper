# Certified Mapper for R

This package implements two of the Certified Mapper methods
from Vejdemo-Johansson and Leshchenko: Certified Mapper: Repeated
Testing for Acyclicity and Obstructions to the Nerve Lemma.

It depends on and uses the R package `TDA` for persistent homology
and issues certificates for Mapper graphs produced using the R package
`TDAmapper`.
